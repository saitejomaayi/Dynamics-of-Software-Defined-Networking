# Dynamics-of-Software-Defined-Networking

SDN is the network management policy that encapsulates the network control plane from the data plane, enabling the network administrators to program the network behavior.<br />

The primary objective of this project is to explore the capabilities of SDN in enhancing network management. Specifically, the project aims to:<br />
Implement SDN controllers and switches in a network environment.<br />
Develop applications that leverage SDN for dynamic network management.<br />
Evaluate the effectiveness of SDN in improving network performance and scalability.<br />
